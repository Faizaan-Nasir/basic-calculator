# Basic-Calculator 
### An incredibly simple Java Project made so I could explore Java and JavaFX for application development. 
## Features
Well it can add, subtract, multiply, divide and perform modulo operations in left to right precedence.
## Planned Features ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] Implementation of operator precedence
- [x] Adding backspace button
- [x] Adding All Clear button
- [x] Allowing users to directly type from keyboard
## Known Issues 
- Enter or Space causes AC to trigger resetting the value to 0
- No handling of division by zero error
- No handling of invalid entry such as operators without preceeding numbers
## Potential Issues
- Delete and AC are not yet mapped to keyboard which may get triggered unintentionally
- Keys that have empty character when recorded may trigger random buttons
